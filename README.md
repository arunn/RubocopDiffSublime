# RubocopDiffSublime
Sublime plugin for rubocop on git diff

# What does it do?

It runs rubocop on the git diff of the active view file and shows gutter icons on the error lines. 
When hovered on the gutter icon, it shows the error messages for the lines in a popup. 

# TODO

When there are other icons present in the gutter(for ex: GitGutter), RubocopDiffSublime's icons and popups are not being shown. This needs to be fixed.
